# custom_overlay
Custom discord overlay page that connects to a websocket and draws rectangles. <br>
Could be used to draw ESP or other things on top of games. <br>
Works with https://github.com/shuruk421/CS2CheatPOC
To connect to discord change `host.js` and `securityUtils.js` files in `...\AppData\Local\Discord\app-1.0.9012\modules\discord_overlay2-1\discord_overlay2`
